# userscripts
## Description
Tampermonkey scripts that I made.
## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887).
- If you're using Userscripts, make sure you have a folder with the scripts you wanna use.
### Installing A Script
#### For Tampermonkey
- Go to the script page, and hit "Raw".
- Alternatively, you can copy the source code, hit "Create a new script..." on Tampermonkey, and paste that code. 
#### For Userscripts
- Save the script, then move it in the folder with your scripts (if you have to).
- On Safari, refresh the scripts, then refresh the tabs.
- You can also close, then reopen Safari as well. 
## Help
If the script doesn't run after installation, try restarting your browser.
